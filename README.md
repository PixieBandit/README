# Taylor Jenkins (PixieBandit)

I build backend systems and automation that have to work outside of demo conditions.
Most of my recent work is around agent tooling, orchestration, and reliability.

## Featured projects

### [OpenPM](https://github.com/PixieBandit/OpenPM)
Multi-agent orchestration tooling for routing work and keeping context intact.

- Coordinates specialized agents without turning into chaos
- Built for practical task execution, not toy examples
- Focus: reliability, visibility, and predictable behavior

### UniversalWebSocket
Shared websocket layer used across multiple services.

- Standardized connection lifecycle and retries
- Reduced duplicate transport code across projects
- Focus: stability under long-running workloads

### CrystalClaw / OpenClaw ecosystem work
Automation + assistant infrastructure across messaging and scheduled workflows.

- Cross-channel automation and reminder flows
- Real-world tool calling and failure handling
- Continuous iteration based on production usage

## Current focus

- Production-grade agent workflows
- Better observability and debugging in automation stacks
- Shipping backend + AI features that are maintainable long-term
